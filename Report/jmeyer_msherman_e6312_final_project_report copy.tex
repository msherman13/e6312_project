\begin{abstract}
A switched-capacitor amplifier with a nominal gain of 4 was designed for use in a 2.5 bit/stage pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The total resolution of the ADC was 10 bits. The sample rate of the ADC was $5kS/s$. The amplifier consisted of 4 sample capacitors and 1 hold capacitor in feedback around an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). The OTA consisted of a pMOS-input folded cascode stage followed by an nMOS common source stage. The open loop DC gain of the OTA was $110.9dB$. The unity gain bandwidth of the OTA was $87.1kHz$. The circuit consumed MAKE THIS MORE ACCURATE $725nW$ of DC power. SOMETHING ABOUT EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF BITS. SOMETHING ABOUT FIGURE OF MERIT.

\section{Open Loop OTA Results}
Upon completion of our OTA design, we performed various open-loop simulations to verify that we had met our required specifications.

\subsection{Open Loop Differential Frequency Response}
Keeping the entire switch capacitor system in perspective, the most important specs for us to hit were those for differential gain for total accuracy and unity-gain bandwidth (UGB) for total speed. Therefore, we measured those performance values for our OTA first. As can be seen in our differential gain plot (Figure \ref{fig:open_dm_gain}), we successfully hit our specs for gain and UGB across all three PVT corners (see Table \ref{tab:specs_results}). The plot also shows that we were able to use compensation capacitance to push our dominant pole to a very low frequency ($\approx0.1 Hz$).

We also plotted the phase response of our open loop OTA (see Figure \ref{fig:open_dm_phase}). From this plot, the low frequency pole seen in the gain response is confirmed. In addition, it can clearly be seen that the additional poles and the zero created by the compensation capacitor has been pushed out beyond our unity-gain bandwidth. Our phase margin measurements are shown to be very consistent across PVT corners and all above our spec (see Figure \ref{tab:specs_results}).

\label{fig:open_dm_phase}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Open Loop Common Frequency Mode Response}
In order for our OTA to be robust against common-mode noise, it is important for the common mode gain to remain very low across all frequencies. As can be seen in our plots for common mode gain (Figure \ref{fig:open_cm_gain}) and common mode phase (Figure \ref{fig:open_cm_phase}), common mode changes on the input have a very limited effect on the output.

\caption{The open loop common mode gain phase response of the OTA.}
\label{fig:open_cm_phase}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Common Mode Feedback Frequency Response}
Our goal in developing a common mode feedback (CMFB) network was to provide circuitry to hold our output node at $V_{CM}$. To ensure that our circuit was functioning as we intended, we broke our feedback loop at the input of the CMFB network and stimulated the circuit with a small signal source. We then measured the output of the CMFB circuit at the node that feeds back to our cascade branch. Our results can be seen in figures \ref{fig:open_cmfb_gain} and \ref{fig:open_cmfb_phase}.

\section{Closed Loop Amplifier Results}
After we verified that we had met our open loop OTA specifications, we replaced the ideal OTA in our system level design with our own OTA design to verify that we still met the system level specifications.

\subsection{Nyquist Rate Sinusoidal Transient Response}
The first test we ran on our system was a sine wave input at our full-scale amplitude and the Nyquist frequency. As can be seen in our plot (Figure \ref{fig:closed_sine}), our system samples the input at the end of the sample phase to be $0.35V$ ($V_{FS}$). Over the course of the hold phase, the output slews and then settles linearly to a value of $1.402V$. This is within our maximum error value and shows that our circuit successfully handles a sine wave input. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in]{Plots/closed_sine.eps}
\caption{The closed loop transient response to a full-scale amplitude sinusoid at the Nyquist frequency.}
\label{fig:closed_sine}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Small Step Transient Response}
The second test we performed on our closed loop system was a small step input. As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:closed_small_step}, our output shows a fast settling with little to no slewing. We provided an input step of $2mV$ and observed the output to settle to $8.012mV$ at the end of the hold phase. This is well within our spec for error so this test was successful.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in]{Plots/closed_small_step.eps}
\caption{The closed loop transient response to a small amplitude step input.}
\label{fig:closed_small_step}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Full Scale Step Transient Response}
The third test we performed on our closed loop system was a step input at the full-scale voltage. The results of this test closely resembled those of the sine wave input. The reason for this is that the input is again sampled at the full-scale voltage and the output settles accordingly. This test was successful.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in]{Plots/closed_large_step.eps}
\caption{The closed loop transient response to a full-scale amplitude step input.}
\label{fig:closed_large_step}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sawtooth Transient Response}
The fourth and final test we performed on our closed loop system was a sawtooth input at $f_s/20$. As can be seen from our plot in figure \ref{fig:closed_saw}, our system has no problem settling to the correct output for small changes in the input (along the ramp of the sawtooth). In addition, our output settles to the correct output in time after the edge of the sawtooth when the input drops from the full-scale voltage to the negative full-scale voltage.

\subsection{Effective Number of Bits}

\subsection{Figure of Merit}
We calculated our figure of merit based on both the DC power consumption of our system as well as the average overall power of our system. Both values of power are shown in table \ref{tab:specs_results} and the FOM values are shown below.

\begin{equation}
FOM_{DC-POWER} = \frac{Power_{dc}}{2^{ENOB}f_s} = 150.3 fJ
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
FOM_{TOTAL-POWER} = \frac{Power_{total}}{2^{ENOB}f_s} = 441.4 fJ
\end{equation}
